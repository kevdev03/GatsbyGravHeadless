{"data":{"snipcartProduct":{"userDefinedId":"1","description":"A drip torch is used to set backfires, burnouts, and prescribed burns. The drip torch consists of a canister for holding fuel with a handle attached to the side, a spout with a loop to prevent fire from entering the fuel canister, a breather valve to allow air into the canister while fuel is exiting through the spout, and a wick from which flaming fuel is dropped to the ground. The wick is ignited and allows the fire to be directed as needed. The spout and wick can be secured upside down inside the canister for storage or transport. Typically, a mixture of kerosene and diesel is used. Amounts are adjusted according to locale, fuel and weather conditions.","image":{"path":"http://localhost/sgh/undefined"},"name":" Fire Blanket","price":"300"}},"pageContext":{}}
